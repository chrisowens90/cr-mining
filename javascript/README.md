## Tech choices

### Material-UI
A simple ui framework for ReactJS - it's very similar too Bootstrap UI.

### Redux
If this were to be made into a proper app Redux would significantly improve state management.

### Typescript v Javascript
I would normally use Typescript for a React App as a find the typing pretty useful. I wasn't  too sure if it would pass the JavaScript requirement so I've opted to skip it for this submission.

### Date handling
I would normally use a library like moment-js in order to handle the significant number of edge cases associated with dates and times in JavaScript.

## Requirements assumptions

### Australian time
I have assumed that this is AEST/GMT+10.

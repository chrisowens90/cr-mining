## Tech choices

### Material-UI
A simple ui framework for ReactJS - it's very similar too Bootstrap UI.  


### Redux  
If this were to be made into a proper app Redux would significantly improve state management.  


### Typescript v Javascript  
I would normally use Typescript for a React App as a find the typing pretty useful. I wasn't  too sure if it would pass the JavaScript requirement so I've opted to skip it for this submission.  


### Date handling  
I would normally use a library like moment-js in order to handle the significant number of edge cases associated with dates and times in JavaScript.  


## Requirements assumptions  

### Australian time  
I have assumed that this is AEST/GMT+10.  
Assumes that shift start is always formatted hhmm ({hours}{minutes}).
